# play.gno

Repository to play around with gno to create some POCs

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Go](https://golang.org/dl/)
- Gno.land's development tool: `gnodev`

> If you don't have `gnodev` yet, you can build it from the Gno.land repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gnolang/gno
cd gno
make install
```

To launch the local Gno web interface:

```bash
gnodev
```
Then open your browser and go to:

```bash
http://localhost:8888/r/home/lou
```
